#How to create a channel.

A channel is an abstraction of any data source. You use it to publish messages that are broadcast to all the subscribers of that channel.

You create channels in your scriptr.io account from the [workspace](https://www.scriptr.io/workspace), by clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner of the screen and select Channels

In the channel configuration pannel, just click + Add channel, give a name to your channel, and you are set!

**Note: if you wish to allow un-authenticated third parties (e.g. remote applications) to publish messages to the channel, respectively consume messages from it, you can tick the corresponding boxes (allow anonymous publishers, respectively, allow anonymous subscribers).
This is not recommended but can be useful for demo purposes.**

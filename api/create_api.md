# How to Create a Secure and Scalable API
Scripts are the main components of any scriptr.io application. By default, any script you write is automatically deployed as a secure and scalable API.

**Note**: all scripts are written in standard JavaScript, deployed and ran on the back-end.

- Open your scriptr.io [workspace](https://www.scriptr.io/workspace). In the bottom left corner, click on "New Script". 
- In the editor, simply type the below:
```
return "greetings"
```
- Click on "Save" in the toolbar to save the script (or type CTRL + S)

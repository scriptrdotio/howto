# How to schedule the automatic execution of a script (cron job)?

Scriptr.io allows you to automatically execute your scripts are regular intervals. 
There are two ways to do this: 
- From the [workspace](https://www.scriptr.io/workspace]
- From the code of a script

** Note** scheduled scripts should have a return instruction (you cannot schedule the execution of modules)

## Schedule the automatic execution of a script from the workspace

From the [workspace](https://www.scriptr.io/workspace], select an existing script from the tree view on left-side, 
or create a new script (click on New Script) and type some instructions. Once you script is ready, click on the **âŒšchedule** button in the script editor toolbar.

From the "Schedule script" dialog, define your scheduling rule:

- Specify if the script should execture regularly (**every**) or at at specified date/time (**on**)
- Specify the time range (hour, day, week, month or year)
- Specify the hour of execution
- Specify the minute of execution

In the below example, we schedule the script to run every data at 08:00 AM.

**Note** if you are familiar with [cron expressions](https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html), you can directly write an expression by clicking on the Advanced link.

Click on the check sign to save your trigger. It is added to the list of triggers of the script (you can define many triggers for the same script)

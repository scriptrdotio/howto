# Purpose of this document

As you may already know, scriptr.io is a [managed serveless environment](../whatis/whatis_scriptr.md). This mainly means that it will make your life easier when developping your applications, whether these are simple IoT applications ingesting and displaying device data, or large enterprise-grade solutions, integrating with multiple third parties and legacy systems.

Software architects and developers that are new to scriptr.io, an less familiar with serveless environments, might sometimes be disoriented at first and they have some - legitimate - questions, some are related to the development life-cycle and some others to the possible architectures of the solutions you can build with scriptr.io:

- How do we work as a team? Are there development and staging environments? How do we test our code, etc.?
- What type of software architectures can I implement? How de they scale, etc.?

This document is thus aimed at providing answers to the most common questions we have received and is structure as follows: 

- First section will tackle questions around the development life-cycle
- Second section will describe how to implement some of the most common architecture patterns with scriptr.io
- Third section will discuss scalability.


# Development life-cycle

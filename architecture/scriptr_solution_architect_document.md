# Purpose of this document

As you may already know, scriptr.io is a [managed serveless environment](../whatis/whatis_scriptr.md) that provides many services and components that you can leverage from within your code. This mainly means that it will make your life much easier when developping your applications, whether these are simple IoT applications ingesting and displaying device data, or large enterprise-grade solutions, integrating with multiple third parties and legacy systems.

Software architects and developers that are new to scriptr.io, and less familiar with serveless environments, might sometimes be disoriented at first as how to start. They often have some - legitimate - questions, some related to the development life-cycle and some others to the possible architectures of the solutions you can build with scriptr.io: ow do we work as a team? Are there development and staging environments? How do we test our code? What type of software architectures can I implement? How do we scale, etc.?

This document is thus aimed at providing answers to the most common questions we have received and is structured as follows: 

- First section will tackle questions around the development life-cycle
- Second section will describe how to implement some of the most common architecture patterns with scriptr.io
- Third section will discuss scalability.

Of course, you can always [contact us](mailto:support@scriptr.io) for any question. We also recommend checking the [how-to guides](https://github.com/scriptrdotio/howto/blob/master/README.md#how-to) and scriptr.io's [official documentation](https://www.scriptr.io/documentation).

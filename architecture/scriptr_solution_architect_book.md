# Architecture patterns

As you may already know, scriptr.io is a [managed serveless environment](../whatis/whatis_scriptr.md). This mainly means that it will make your life easier when developping your applications, whether these are simple IoT applications ingesting and displaying device data, or large enterprise-grade solutions, integrating with multiple third parties and legacy systems.

# Scriptr.io solution architect booklet

As you may already know, scriptr.io is a [managed serveless environment](../whatis/whatis_scriptr.md) that provides many services and components that you can leverage from within your code. This mainly means that it will make your life much easier when developping your applications, whether these are simple IoT applications ingesting and displaying device data, or large enterprise-grade solutions, integrating with multiple third parties and legacy systems.

Software architects and developers that are new to scriptr.io, and less familiar with serveless environments, might sometimes be disoriented at first as how to start. They often have some - legitimate - questions, some related to the development life-cycle and some others to the possible architectures of the solutions they can build with scriptr.io: how to work as a team? Are there development and staging environments? How to test the code? What type of software architectures can be implemented? How to scale, etc.? Some other questions also relate to security and authorizations.

This document is thus aimed at providing answers to the most common questions we encounter, and is structured as follows: 

- First section is a short discussion on the different scriptr.io [configurations](./environment_configurations.md) that are provided by default
- Second section tackles questions around the [development life-cycle](./development_life_cycle.md)
- Third section describes how to implement some of the most [common architecture patterns](./scriptr_solution_architect_document.md#architecture-patterns) with scriptr.io
- Fourth section discusses [scalability](./scriptr_solution_architect_document.md#scalability)
- Fifth section covers [security](./security).

Of course, you can always [contact us](mailto:support@scriptr.io) for any question. We also recommend checking the [how-to guides](https://github.com/scriptrdotio/howto/blob/master/README.md#how-to) and scriptr.io's [official documentation](https://www.scriptr.io/documentation).

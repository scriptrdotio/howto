# Microservices

Microservice architectures are an evolution of SOA. Microservice are software components that implement the logic of a specific domain (e.g. order management, maintenance operation scheduling, etc.)
Microservices are deployed as separate decoupled units, exposing operations through remotely accessible interfaces and communicating with each other through remote communication protocols (http, mqtt, etc.). As a consequence, Microservice architectures fall into the category of distributed software architectures.

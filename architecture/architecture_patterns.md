# Architecture patterns

Scriptr.io allows you to very simply implement most of the software architecture patterns you need to implement scalable, robust and flexible solutions.
In this section, we will cover four of them:

- [Broker](./broker.md)
- [Mediator](./mediator.md)
- [Micro-service](./micro_services.md)
- [Layered (monolithic](./layered.md)

In a few words: 

- Scriptr is a cloud-based platform for developing and executing IoT solutions. It offers a set of tools, components and APIs to reduce the effort and time to market IoT applications.
- Everything you code is automatically deployed in a secure and scalable cloud environment, releaving you from DevOps operations
- Scriptr is a managed service, so we take care of monitoring the health of your applications

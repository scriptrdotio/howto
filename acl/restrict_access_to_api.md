# How do I restrict access to my API?

Scripts are the main components of any scriptr.io application. By default, any script you write is automatically deployed as a secure and scalable API. All scripts are written in standard JavaScript, deployed and ran on the back-end.

## Defining authorizations

By default, a script is ony accesible to entities (users, devices) that are authenticated by your scriptr.io account, thus scriptr.io always makes sure that your APIs are not accessed by unauthorized parties. This is visually expressed by the small red lock that appears on the right of the script editor in your [workspacde](https://www.scriptr.io/workspace)

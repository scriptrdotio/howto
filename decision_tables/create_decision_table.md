# How to use decision tables?

Scriptr allows you to create advanced condition/action evaluation logic without coding, through [decision tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_table).

## Create a decision table

To create a decision table, click on the arrow near +New Script on the bottom left corner of the script, then select **Decision Tables**.

The upper-left side of the decision table is where you set the criteria that you need to evaluate, and the columns specify the rules (conditions) you want to associate to these criteria.
